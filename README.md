#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret the user needs and implement them into a program we will first have our Product Owner meet with clients to get their requirments and request and the priorities of the functionality to be implemented. Then we will create user stories to make a narrative for what functionallity is to be added and how it should behave in the program and add them to the backlog. Finally, we will develop the features from the backlog in order of priority in iterations.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I enjoy how user stories give a narrative to features to be emplemented. I believe I will utilize the iteration of features when developing software in the future.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that mastering communication is a good place to start in becoming a good team member. Being a good collaborator and being responsible for fulfiling your role on the team are also good traits of a team member.
